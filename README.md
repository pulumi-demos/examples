# Yet another Examples repo?

There is a large collection of examples in the [Pulumi examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).
The examples in that repo are generally pretty simple and are generally meant to provide a good set of introductory use-cases that requires minimal setup and understanding.

This repo, [Pulumi-Demos examples](https://github.com/pulumi-demos/pulumi-deployments), is part of a github org used by the pre and post sales teams. The intent of this repo is to reflect larger scale and more involved use-cases and examples to demonstrate key Pulumi concepts and constructs.
