# Python Automation API Example
Provides an example of using automation API using Python.


## Main Talking Points
* Shows the automation API SDK in action.
  * Show how you are basically doing `pulumi up` and `pulumi destroy`, etc in code instead of command line.
* This code can then be plugged into a web-service or similar system to enable self-service, etc.
* Although the `deployments.json` file is hand-crafted in this example, it could be generated by parsing the folders containing the Pulumi projects.

## Main Components of the Example

* `deployments.yaml`: This file captures the information needed for the orchestration logic. Specifically, it provides information on how to find and run specific stacks including multi-stack use-cases. It is hand-crafted to allow you to demo what you want. 
* `orchestration`: This folder contains the orchestration logic used to manage the projects and stacks. It is called by the code in the `run-automation` folder.
* `run-automation`: This folder contains the command line code that is executed to run the automation logic.

## Running the Example

* Modify the `deployments.json` file as you wish or use it as-is.
* Navigate to the `run-automation` folder.
* Run `python ./main.py`
